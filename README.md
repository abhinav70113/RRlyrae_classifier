# RRlyrae_classifier
Building a classifier by estimating the probability density function of rrlyrae variable stars using normalizing flows
This project was done as a term-assignment with lennart Boehm as a part of the lecture "Advanced Methods of Data Analysis" by Prof. Sebastian Neubert at the University of Bonn.

The base code was taken from public github repo of Lukas Rinder (https://github.com/abhinav70113/normalizing-flows.git)

Based on the modules from Rinder's implementation of normalizing flows, "DataAnalysisScript.py" is the data analysis architecture for determining the probability density function using the neural splines algortithm. "RRLyraeClassifier" takes the pdf estimates from the previous script and classify the objects in the test dataset as either a RRlyrae variable star or a general star.

A very general implementation of the classifier has been done in Main_file.ipynb. The plots and files generated by this script are recorded in "Misc" folder.

For a thorough theoretical and practical explanation of the classifier, refer to "Term_project.pdf"
